This extension provides language features for the CBS (Curly Braced Syntaxes) grammar used in the RisuAI program.
Therefore, this extension must be created strictly following RisuAI's grammar.

The src folder in cbs_reference contains RisuAI's code.
Multiple CBS documents are located in cbs_reference\src\etc\docs.
cbs_reference\src\ts\cbs.ts and cbs_reference\src\ts\parser.svelte.ts contain the actual code implementing CBS.

Please refer to these documents carefully while coding.

There is no need to run npm compile after code modification. Review the codes you modified again to see if they are correct
